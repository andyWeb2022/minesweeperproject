Implement the classic Windows game Minesweeper.
The game has the following rules:
Clicking a mine ends the game.
Clicking a square with an adjacent mine clears that square and shows the number of mines touching it.
Clicking a square with no adjacent mine clears that square and clicks all adjacent squares.
This first click can never be a mine.
The numbers reflect the number of mines touching a square.
Right clicking on a square puts a flag on it. The flagged square can’t be opened by a click.
If the number in a square is equal to the number of squares touching that square that are flagged, double clicking on the number opens up all remaining squares around the number. (Note: this won’t work on touch screen devices)
Your submission will be evaluated for:
